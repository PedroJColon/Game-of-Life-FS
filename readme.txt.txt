A feature I added for the project is the ability to change the display color.

Orignally I wanted to get the transparency effect but instead I decided to allow the user to change the display color.

To change color, you can do it either with the context sensesitve menu, under color there should be a display color menu item.

Another way, is by clicking on Tools, going onto customize and you should see the display color menu item there as well!
